# This java program finds the sum of all the primes numbers within 2 million. Shouldn't be that hard.
	Loop through all the numbers within 2 million #BruteForce
	if the number is prime (we've already made a isPrime() so we just added it to this project)
		add it to the sum
	return once the loop is done

# This program finds the only pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1,000 
	Function that finds the triplet
		loop through all the possible combinations of a and b
			find c by finding the sum of a squared and b squared
			if a + b + c is the number
				return the values of a,b,and c
	multiply a,b,and c to find the product
